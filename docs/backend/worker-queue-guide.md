# Worker Queue Guide — Signing Attempts + River

Background job processing for signing attempts using [River](https://riverqueue.com), a PostgreSQL-native job queue for Go.

River is the only durable execution engine for signing side effects. The business document row is a projection; the technical execution source of truth is `execution.signing_attempts`.

## Architecture Overview

River runs inside the same Go process as the API server, sharing the PostgreSQL connection pool. No external broker (Redis, RabbitMQ) is needed.

        SVC[Signing services]
        UOW[SigningExecutionUnitOfWork]
        W[River attempt workers]
    end

    PG[(PostgreSQL)]
    STORE[(Storage)]
    PROVIDER[Signing provider]
    SDK[SDK consumer]

    API -->|proceed / session / webhook| SVC
    SVC --> UOW
    UOW -->|attempt mutation + river_job| PG
    W -->|poll river_job| PG
    W -->|render immutable PDF| STORE
    W -->|submit / refresh / cleanup| PROVIDER
    W -->|completion dispatch| SDK
```

## Source of Truth

| Concept | Owner |
|---|---|
| Current business state visible to users | `execution.documents.status` |
| Active technical execution | `execution.documents.active_attempt_id` |
| Render/provider/retry/reconciliation state | `execution.signing_attempts` |
| Signer provider references and embedded URLs | `execution.signing_attempt_recipients` |
| Attempt audit trail and webhook history | `execution.signing_attempt_events` |
| Durable async execution | `river_job` |

`Document` status is recomputed from the active attempt only. Superseded or invalidated historical attempts can record events, but they must not mutate the active document projection.

## Attempt Jobs

All signing jobs carry `attempt_id` and are unique by attempt + phase (`ByArgs` + 24h):

| Job kind | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `render_attempt_pdf` | Render immutable pre-signed PDF for one attempt. |
| `submit_attempt_to_provider` | Submit the stored PDF snapshot to the signing provider. |
| `reconcile_provider_submission` | Resolve ambiguous provider submission outcome by correlation key when supported. |
| `refresh_attempt_provider_status` | Refresh provider status/signing references for an active attempt. |
| `cleanup_provider_attempt` | Best-effort cancellation/cleanup for superseded provider documents. |
| `dispatch_attempt_completion` | Build and deliver the SDK `DocumentCompletedEvent` for the active completed attempt. |

## Public/Auth Proceed Flow

`ProceedToSigning` does not render or upload inline. It creates or reuses the active attempt and lets River advance the phases.

    participant River as River Worker
    participant Provider as Signing Provider

        Note over UOW,PG: Single PostgreSQL transaction
        UOW->>PG: INSERT signing_attempt / set active_attempt_id
        UOW->>PG: INSERT river_job(render_attempt_pdf)
    end

    Svc-->>Front: step=processing

    River->>PG: Run render_attempt_pdf(attempt_id)
    River->>River: Render PDF snapshot
    River->>PG: PDF_READY + enqueue submit_attempt_to_provider

    River->>PG: Run submit_attempt_to_provider(attempt_id)
    River->>Provider: SubmitAttemptDocument(correlation_key={document_id}:{attempt_id})
    Provider-->>River: provider_document_id + recipient refs
    River->>PG: SIGNING_READY + document READY_TO_SIGN

    Front->>API: Poll GET /public/sign/{token}
    API-->>Front: step=signing + embeddedSigningUrl
```

## Transactional Boundaries

Each durable transition that schedules follow-up work happens in one PostgreSQL transaction:

| Transition | Same-transaction enqueue |
|---|---|
| Attempt created/reused | `render_attempt_pdf` |
| PDF rendered and stored | `submit_attempt_to_provider` |
| Provider result ambiguous | `reconcile_provider_submission` |
| Active attempt completed | `dispatch_attempt_completion` |
| Attempt superseded after provider submit | `cleanup_provider_attempt` |

This prevents states such as “PDF_READY but no submit job” or “COMPLETED but no completion dispatch”.

## Provider Failure Handling

Provider operations cannot be part of the local DB transaction, so errors are classified and persisted on the attempt:

| Error class | State behavior |
|---|---|
| `TRANSIENT` | Persist retryable state and let River retry the same attempt. |
| `PERMANENT` | Mark attempt `FAILED_PERMANENT`; document projection becomes `ERROR` if active. |
| `AMBIGUOUS` | Mark `SUBMISSION_UNKNOWN` and enqueue reconciliation. |
| `CONFLICT_STALE` | Mark `REQUIRES_REVIEW` or safe no-op for stale/historical work. |

Reconciliation uses the provider correlation key when supported. If the provider cannot reconcile, the attempt eventually moves to `REQUIRES_REVIEW` rather than creating duplicate provider documents.

## Webhook and Completion Dispatch

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Provider as Signing Provider
    participant Webhook as WebhookController
    participant Repo as SigningAttemptRepository
    participant UOW as SigningExecutionUnitOfWork
    participant PG as PostgreSQL
    participant River as dispatch_attempt_completion
    participant SDK as SDK Handler

    Provider->>Webhook: completed / declined / recipient event
    Webhook->>Repo: Lookup by provider_name + provider_document_id or correlation key
    Repo-->>Webhook: attempt + document

    alt attempt is historical
        Webhook->>Repo: Insert event only
    else attempt is active
        Webhook->>UOW: Apply webhook transition
        UOW->>PG: update attempt + recipients + document projection
        UOW->>PG: enqueue dispatch_attempt_completion when completed
        River->>PG: Load active completed attempt + document
        River->>SDK: handler(ctx, DocumentCompletedEvent)
    end
```

The dispatch worker always verifies `document.active_attempt_id == attempt_id` before invoking the SDK handler. Stale completion jobs complete as no-ops.

## Document Projection

| Active attempt status | Document status |
|---|---|
| `CREATED`, `RENDERING`, `READY_TO_SUBMIT`, `SUBMITTING_PROVIDER`, `PROVIDER_RETRY_WAITING`, `SUBMISSION_UNKNOWN` | `PREPARING_SIGNATURE` |
| `SIGNING_READY` | `READY_TO_SIGN` |
| `SIGNING` | `SIGNING` |
| `COMPLETED` | `COMPLETED` |
| `DECLINED` | `DECLINED` |
| `FAILED_PERMANENT`, `REQUIRES_REVIEW` | `ERROR` |
| `SUPERSEDED`, `INVALIDATED`, `CANCELLED` | Historical only; must not project unless active by mistake. |

## Public Page States

The public signing page exposes user-safe steps, not internal attempt statuses:

| Step | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `preview` | Show form or PDF preview before signing starts. |
| `processing` | Active attempt is being rendered/submitted/reconciled by River. |
| `signing` | Provider signing URL is ready for the token recipient. |
| `waiting` | Earlier signer must sign first. |
| `completed` | Document completed; signed PDF may be downloadable. |
| `declined` | Document declined. |
| `document_updated` | Token is bound to an old/superseded attempt; user must use a fresh document link. |
| `unavailable` | Active attempt failed permanently or requires review. |

## Configuration

In `settings/app.yaml`:

```yaml
worker:
  enabled: false              # DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_ENABLED
  max_workers: 10             # DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_MAX_WORKERS
  runtime_environment: local  # DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT
  failpoints_enabled: false   # DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_FAILPOINTS_ENABLED
  failpoints: []              # DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_FAILPOINTS
```

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_ENABLED` | `false` | Starts River workers when true. When false, jobs can still be inserted transactionally but are not processed. |
| `DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_MAX_WORKERS` | `10` | Max concurrent worker goroutines for the default queue. |
| `DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT` | `local` | Runtime guard for worker behavior. Production disables failpoints. |
| `DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_FAILPOINTS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables non-production signing attempt failure injection. Ignored in production/prod. |
| `DOC_ENGINE_WORKER_FAILPOINTS` | empty | CSV failpoint names for live development/test validation. |

Supported non-production failpoints:

- `render.before`
- `render.after_store_before_commit`
- `submit.before_provider`
- `submit.corrupt_pdf_checksum`
- `submit.after_provider_accepted_before_commit`
- `cleanup.fail`

## SDK Types

The SDK completion handler remains document-level, but dispatch is attempt-aware internally:

```go
import "github.com/rendis/doc-assembly/core/sdk"

handler := func(ctx context.Context, ev sdk.DocumentCompletedEvent) error {
    log.Printf("Document %s completed in tenant %s", ev.DocumentID, ev.TenantCode)
    for _, r := range ev.Recipients {
        log.Printf("  %s (%s) signed at %v", r.Name, r.RoleName, r.SignedAt)
    }
    return nil // return error to retry dispatch_attempt_completion
}
```

## Integration Tests

Located at `internal/infra/riverqueue/river_integration_test.go`. Run with:

```bash
go test -C core -tags=integration -run TestRiver -v -count=1 ./internal/infra/riverqueue/
```

Coverage includes:

| Area | What it validates |
|---|---|
| Atomic enqueue | Attempt creation/state transition and River job insertion commit or roll back together. |
| Concurrency | Concurrent `ProceedToSigning` creates/reuses one active attempt. |
| Constraints | `active_attempt_id` must belong to the same document; provider document/correlation keys are unique. |
| Deduplication | Same `attempt_id + phase` does not duplicate jobs. |
| Regeneration | Superseding an attempt enqueues cleanup for old provider state. |
| Stale work | Historical completion dispatch and late webhook do not mutate active document projection. |
| Failpoints | Render, submit, ambiguous provider result, corrupt PDF checksum, cleanup failure, and restart-safe states. |
| Completion | Active completed attempt dispatches the SDK event through River. |

## Database Tables

River manages its own tables (auto-migrated on startup):

- `river_job` — Job queue with args (JSONB), state, attempt count.
- `river_migration` — Schema version tracking.

Signing attempts live in the application schema:

- `execution.signing_attempts`
- `execution.signing_attempt_recipients`
- `execution.signing_attempt_events`
