# Injector i18n — human-readable labels and descriptions for the template editor UI.
# These merge with (and override) the built-in translations shipped by doc-assembly.
#
# The top-level key is the injector code, which MUST match the value returned by
# the injector's Code() method (e.g., GreetingInjector.Code() == "example_greeting").
#
# Format:
#   <injector_code>:
#     label:
#       <lang>: "Localized Label"
#     description:
#       <lang>: "Localized description"
#
# Notes:
#   - "en" (English) is the minimum required language; other languages are optional.
#   - If a language is missing, the engine falls back to "en".
#   - Keep labels short (1-3 words); descriptions can be a brief sentence.

example_greeting:
  label:
    en: "Greeting"
    es: "Saludo"
  description:
    en: "A greeting message"
    es: "Un mensaje de saludo"
